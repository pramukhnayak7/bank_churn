# 🏦 Bank Churn Prediction

A Machine Learning project that predicts whether a customer will **churn** (leave the bank) or **stay**, based on historical customer data.  
This model helps banks identify at-risk customers early and take proactive measures to improve customer retention.

## 🚀 Project Overview
